I've seen a lot about 15 minute cities recently: 
>"this simple notion that all your basic everyday needs, from education to commerce to health care to culture and so on, are located within 15 minutes walk or bike >of your front door".

I'm not sure how it might work - do people get to mix? Might you lose the special things you get in a city centre when you have to endlessly repeat the basics? I like having a pub near my house, but I'm definitely prepared to travel slightly further to exhibitions, libraries and well-equiped maker spaces.

It is an interesting way of looking at we do need though, and how we can move away from cars to cycling and walking more - this seems like a good time to think about things when everything has already been shaken up by the COVID crisis - for me that means that the office I usually work from in Greater Manchester is closed, and I'm working from the coworking space at [DoES Liverpool](doesliverpool.com) (just over half an hour's cycling from my home, so it doesn't quite fit into the 15 minute city idea, but I love cycling into work- it gives me time to think and stuff to look at, and it's good for you).

It seems like a good lunchtime project to start by exploring the area around DoES Liverpool - Adrian McEwen has been working on isochrone maps which show how far you can get in 15 minutes by cycling or walking (including for people with mobility issues) - you can find out more here: http://trips.mcqn.com/. Here's one of his maps showing how far you can get from DoES Liverpool in 15 minutes:

I started by just walking to Rodney Street and back on Monday lunchtime - it took exactly half an hour, so the map is accurate!
